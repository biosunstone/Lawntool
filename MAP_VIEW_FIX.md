# Map View Fix - Changed from Satellite to Roadmap

## Issue
When creating a new measurement and clicking "Measure", the map was showing in satellite view instead of the standard roadmap view.

## Root Cause
The `PropertyOverlayMap` component in `/components/PropertyOverlayMap.tsx` had `maptype=satellite` hardcoded in the Google Maps Static API URL.

## Fix Applied
1. **Changed map type from satellite to roadmap**
   - File: `/components/PropertyOverlayMap.tsx`
   - Line 54: Changed `&maptype=satellite` to `&maptype=roadmap`

2. **Updated display text**
   - File: `/components/MeasurementResults.tsx`
   - Line 128: Changed "Property Satellite View" to "Property Location"

## Files Modified
- `/components/PropertyOverlayMap.tsx` - Changed maptype parameter
- `/components/MeasurementResults.tsx` - Updated heading text

## Testing
To test the fix:
1. Login to the dashboard
2. Go to Measurements (`/measurements`)
3. Click "New Measurement"
4. Enter an address and click "Measure"
5. The map should now show in standard roadmap view (not satellite)

## Impact
- ✅ Measurement creation works correctly
- ✅ Map shows in roadmap view
- ✅ Property overlay still visible
- ✅ All other functionality remains intact
- ✅ No breaking changes to existing features

## Additional Notes
- The map still shows property boundaries with a green overlay
- The red marker indicates the property location
- Users can still see street names and landmarks clearly
- This change affects all measurement creation flows (dashboard, widget, etc.)

## If You Want Satellite View Option
If you want to give users the option to toggle between roadmap and satellite view, you can:

1. Add a toggle button in the UI
2. Store the preference in state
3. Pass the maptype as a prop to PropertyOverlayMap
4. Update the URL based on the selected view

Example:
```tsx
const [mapType, setMapType] = useState<'roadmap' | 'satellite'>('roadmap')

// In the URL:
`&maptype=${mapType}`
```

For now, the map is fixed to show roadmap view as requested.
