# How to Resume Development Tomorrow

## Quick Start

1. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd /Users/limitless/testproject1/sunstone-digital-tech
```

2. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

3. Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser

## Current State Summary

### What's Working:
- ✅ Address search with autocomplete (US & Canada)
- ✅ Satellite map display using Google Maps Embed API
- ✅ Property measurements display
- ✅ Server-side geocoding

### What Needs Work:
- ❌ Measurements are currently randomized (not based on actual satellite data)
- ❌ Need to implement real property boundary detection
- ❌ Animation features are disabled

## Key Files to Know

1. **Main Components:**
   - `components/MeasurementSection.tsx` - Main measurement interface
   - `components/EmbedMap.tsx` - Current working map implementation
   - `components/MeasurementResults.tsx` - Displays measurements

2. **API Routes:**
   - `app/api/geocode/route.ts` - Geocoding endpoint

3. **Environment:**
   - `.env.local` - Contains Google Maps API key

## Next Priority Tasks

1. **Implement Real Measurements:**
   - Use Google Maps Drawing API to detect property boundaries
   - Calculate actual area from satellite imagery
   - Differentiate between lawn, driveway, and building

2. **Fix Animation:**
   - Re-enable the line-by-line measurement animation
   - Optimize performance to prevent timeouts

3. **Improve Accuracy:**
   - Research deeplawn.com's measurement algorithms
   - Implement similar computer vision techniques
