## ‚ùì Frequently Asked Questions

### How is my zone determined?
We use Google Maps to calculate the actual drive time from our office to your property during typical traffic conditions.

### Can my zone change?
Zones are based on drive time, which can vary slightly based on traffic patterns. We use "best guess" traffic modeling for consistency.

### Why do you charge more for distant areas?
The surcharge covers additional travel time, fuel costs, and vehicle maintenance for extended service routes.

### Why do close areas get a discount?
Properties close to our office allow us to service more customers efficiently, and we pass those savings on to you.

### What if I'm right on the boundary between zones?
Our system automatically calculates the exact drive time. If you're at 19 minutes, you're in Zone 2. At 21 minutes, you're in Zone 3.

### Do zones apply to all services?
Yes, the zone adjustment applies equally to lawn care, driveway, and sidewalk services.

### Can I get a custom quote?
Absolutely! Contact us for properties with special requirements or for regular service contracts.
