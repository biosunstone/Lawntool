### 2. **Visual Breakdown Component**
- `PropertyMeasurementBreakdown.tsx` - Comprehensive measurement display
- Shows total property area with detailed breakdown
- Percentage calculations for each area type
- Visual progress bars and distribution chart
- Color-coded legend for easy understanding

### 3. **Map Overlays**
- Toggle-able area overlays on the map
- Color-coded polygons for different area types:

## 🚀 How to Use

1. **Visit**: http://localhost:3001/test-drone-view
2. **Load a Property**: Select from dropdown or search an address
3. **View Breakdown**: See automatic area calculations in the right panel
4. **Toggle Overlays**: Use "Show Areas" checkbox to see visual overlays
5. **Draw Custom**: Use ruler tool to draw custom property boundaries

## 📈 Benefits for Lawn Care Business

1. **Accurate Quotes**: Precise measurements for each service area
2. **Service Planning**: Know exactly what areas need treatment
3. **Customer Communication**: Visual breakdown helps explain pricing
4. **Efficiency**: Quick identification of lawn vs non-lawn areas
