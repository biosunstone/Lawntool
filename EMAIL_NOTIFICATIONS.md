# Email Notifications - Now Working!

## ‚úÖ Email System Implemented

Email notifications are now fully integrated into the quote system. The system automatically sends professional HTML emails for:

1. **Quote Created** - Sent to customers when a quote is created or sent
2. **Quote Accepted** - Notification to business when customer accepts
3. **Quote Rejected** - Notification to business when customer rejects

## üîß How It Works

### Default Configuration (Test Mode)
If no email server is configured, the system uses **Ethereal Email** - a free test email service that:
- Captures all emails safely
- Provides preview URLs in server logs
- Perfect for development and testing
- No emails are actually sent to real addresses

### Production Configuration
To use real email, configure your SMTP settings in `.env.local`:

```env
# Example Gmail Configuration
EMAIL_SERVER=smtp://username@gmail.com:password@smtp.gmail.com:587
EMAIL_FROM=yourcompany@gmail.com

# Example SendGrid Configuration
EMAIL_SERVER=smtp://apikey:YOUR_API_KEY@smtp.sendgrid.net:587
EMAIL_FROM=noreply@yourcompany.com

# Example Custom SMTP
EMAIL_SERVER=smtp://username:password@mail.yourserver.com:587
EMAIL_FROM=quotes@yourcompany.com
```

## üìß Email Templates

### Quote Email to Customer
- Professional HTML design with your branding
- Property details and measurements
- Service breakdown with pricing
- Clear total and validity date
- Direct link to view quote online

### Business Notifications
- Instant alerts when quotes are accepted/rejected

- Action prompts for follow-up

## üß™ Testing Email Notifications

### Method 1: Settings Page
1. Go to `/settings`
2. Click on "Email" tab
3. Enter your email address
4. Click "Send Test Email"
5. Check your inbox (or server logs for preview URL)

### Method 2: Create a Quote
1. Create a measurement
2. Generate a quote from it
3. Click "Send Quote" instead of "Save as Draft"
4. Email is automatically sent to customer

### Method 3: API Test
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/test-email \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"to": "test@example.com"}'
```

## üìù Viewing Test Emails (Development)

When using test mode (no EMAIL_SERVER configured):

1. Check your terminal/console after sending an email
2. Look for: `Preview URL: https://ethereal.email/message/...`
3. Click the URL to see the email in your browser
4. No actual email is sent - perfect for testing!

## üéØ Email Flow

### When Quote is Created/Sent:
1. Quote saved to database
2. Email template generated with quote details
3. Email sent to customer's email address
4. Success/failure logged to console

### When Quote Status Changes:
- **Sent** ‚Üí Customer receives quote email
- **Accepted** ‚Üí Business receives acceptance notification
- **Rejected** ‚Üí Business receives rejection notification

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Options

### Email Server Types Supported:
- Gmail (with app password)
- SendGrid
- Mailgun
- AWS SES
- Any SMTP server

### Security Notes:
- Use app passwords for Gmail, not your regular password
- Store credentials in environment variables only
- Never commit email credentials to git
- Use OAuth2 for production Gmail

## üöÄ Production Checklist

2. ‚úÖ Update EMAIL_FROM to your business email
3. ‚úÖ Test with real email addresses
