# Google Maps Fix Summary

## Issues Found and Fixed

1. **Conflicting Map Implementations**: The app had two different ways of loading Google Maps:
   - `GoogleMapsProvider` using `@react-google-maps/api` (the correct way)
   - `SimpleWorkingMap` manually loading the Google Maps script (causing conflicts)

2. **Component Updates Made**:
   - Created `WorkingPropertyMap.tsx` - A proper map component using the Google Maps Provider
   - Updated `MeasurementResults.tsx` to use `WorkingPropertyMap` instead of `SimpleWorkingMap`
   - Added debug logging to `GoogleMapsProvider.tsx`
   - Added `GoogleMapsDiagnostic.tsx` for development debugging

## Test Pages Created

1. **Basic Test**: `/test-google-maps`
   - Shows API key status
   - Basic map functionality test
   - Error reporting

2. **Minimal Test**: `/test-maps-minimal`
   - Simplest possible map implementation
   - Good for isolating issues

3. **Full Demo**: `/working-map-demo`
   - Complete working example with search
   - Shows all features working together

## How to Test

1. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Visit these URLs to test:
   - http://localhost:3000/working-map-demo - Full working demo
   - http://localhost:3000/test-google-maps - Diagnostic test
   - http://localhost:3000/test-maps-minimal - Minimal test

3. On the main page, try searching for an address in the measurement section

## Debugging Tips

1. Check the browser console for errors
2. Look for the diagnostic widget in the bottom-right corner (development mode only)
3. Verify the API key is set in `.env.local`:
   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

4. Common issues to check:
   - API key has Maps JavaScript API enabled
   - Billing is enabled on the Google Cloud project
   - Domain restrictions include localhost and production domain
   - No conflicting scripts loading Google Maps

## Key Components

- `GoogleMapsProvider` - Wraps the app and loads Google Maps
- `WorkingPropertyMap` - The main map component for property display
- `AddressSearchWithAutocomplete` - Address search with Google Places
- `MeasurementResults` - Shows property measurements with map

The maps should now be working correctly. The issue was primarily due to conflicting implementations and the manual script loading in SimpleWorkingMap.
