# NextAuth (required - generate a secret)
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your-secret-key-here
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000

# Stripe (optional for initial testing)
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_your_key
STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_your_key
```

### Installation & Running

```bash
# Install dependencies (already done)
npm install

# Start MongoDB (if running locally)
mongod

## 🔒 Security Considerations

1. **Authentication**: All dashboard routes are protected
2. **Authorization**: Role-based access control implemented
3. **Data Isolation**: Multi-tenant architecture ensures data separation
4. **Password Security**: Bcrypt hashing with salt rounds
5. **Session Management**: JWT tokens with 30-day expiry

## 🎯 Integration Points

The existing measurement tool is integrated at these points:

1. **AuthenticatedMeasurement Component**: Wraps the measurement tool with auth
2. **Event Listening**: Captures measurement completion events
3. **Database Storage**: Automatically saves measurements
4. **Quota Enforcement**: Checks subscription limits before allowing measurements
5. **History Display**: Shows saved measurements in the dashboard

## 📊 Database Collections

- `users` - User accounts
- `businesses` - Business profiles
- `subscriptions` - Subscription plans and usage
- `measurements` - Measurement history
- `quotes` - Generated quotes
- `customers` - Customer database

## 🛠️ Development Tips

1. **MongoDB Connection**: Ensure MongoDB is running before starting the app
2. **Secret Generation**: Generate NEXTAUTH_SECRET with `openssl rand -base64 32`
3. **Testing Payments**: Use Stripe test mode keys initially
4. **Measurement Testing**: The free plan includes 10 measurements for testing

## 📝 API Endpoints

- `POST /api/auth/signup` - Create new account
- `GET /api/dashboard/stats` - Dashboard statistics
- `GET /api/measurements` - Fetch measurement history
- `POST /api/measurements` - Save new measurement

## 🚦 Status
