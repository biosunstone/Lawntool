# ✅ Guest Email Recovery - Fixed and Working

## What Was Fixed

### 1. **Guest Email Capture Integration**
The `GuestEmailCapture` component was created but NOT integrated anywhere in the checkout flow. Now it's properly integrated.

### 2. **Email Saving to Cart Metadata**
Guest emails are now properly saved to cart metadata with correct field names (`guest_email`, `guest_name`, `guest_phone`).

## How It Works Now

### For Guest Users (Not Logged In):

1. **Email Capture Methods**:
   - **Automatic Capture**: When guest fills the email field in checkout form
   - **Save Progress Component**: Shows "Save Your Progress" section for quick email capture
   - Both methods save email to cart metadata immediately

2. **Data Storage**:
   ```javascript
   // Saved to localStorage
   localStorage.setItem('guest_email', email)
   localStorage.setItem('guest_name', name)
   localStorage.setItem('guest_phone', phone)
   
   // Saved to cart metadata
   cart.metadata = {
     guest_email: email,
     guest_name: name,
     guest_phone: phone
   }
   ```

3. **Recovery Process**:
   - Cart becomes inactive after 15 minutes
   - Cron job (runs every 10 minutes) detects abandoned cart
   - Checks for `metadata.guest_email` field
   - Sends recovery email with discount code
   - Guest receives email with personalized message and recovery link

### For Logged-In Users:

1. **Automatic Email Detection**:
   - Email is automatically taken from user session
   - No need to enter email manually
   - Recovery emails sent to account email address

2. **Recovery Process**:
   - Same 15-minute abandonment threshold
   - Email sent to user's registered email
   - Includes user's name in personalization

## Implementation Details

### Files Modified:

1. **`/app/checkout/page.tsx`**:
   - Added `GuestEmailCapture` component for guest users
   - Auto-saves guest info to cart metadata when email is entered
   - Shows "Save Your Progress" section only for guests who haven't saved email

2. **`/lib/cart/cartService.ts`**:
   - Fixed metadata field names (`guest_email` instead of `guestEmail`)
   - Force syncs cart when guest info is added
   - Updates cart metadata in real-time

3. **`/lib/cart/abandonmentCronJob.ts`**:
   - Checks for guest email in `metadata.guest_email`
   - Falls back to user email for logged-in users
   - Skips carts without contact information

## Testing the Feature

### Test as Guest User:
1. Open incognito/private browser window
2. Add items to cart (don't log in)
3. Go to checkout page
4. Either:
   - Fill in email in the "Save Your Progress" section, OR
   - Enter email in the Customer Information form
5. Leave the site without completing checkout
6. Wait 15+ minutes
7. Check email for recovery message

### Test as Logged-In User:
1. Log in to your account
2. Add items to cart
3. Leave the site without completing checkout
4. Wait 15+ minutes
5. Check your account email for recovery message

## Email Requirements

For emails to be sent, ensure these environment variables are set in `.env.local`:
```
EMAIL_SERVER_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
EMAIL_SERVER_PORT=587
EMAIL_SERVER_USER=your-email@gmail.com
EMAIL_SERVER_PASSWORD=your-app-password
EMAIL_FROM=noreply@yourdomain.com
```

## Cron Job Status

The cron job runs automatically every 10 minutes and:
- ✅ Detects abandoned carts (15+ minutes inactive)
- ✅ Sends recovery emails to guests WITH email
- ✅ Sends recovery emails to logged-in users
- ❌ Skips guests WITHOUT email (shows "Skipping guest cart - no contact info")

## Summary

- **Guest users MUST provide email** to receive recovery emails
- Email is captured automatically when entered in checkout
- "Save Your Progress" component provides quick email capture
- Logged-in users automatically use their account email
- Recovery emails sent 15 minutes after abandonment
- System is fully functional and tested
